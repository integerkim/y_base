          <h4>Today, the metaverse is a shared virtual space where people are represented by digital avatars (think Ready Player One). The virtual world constantly grows and evolves based on the decisions and actions of the society within it. Eventually, people will be able to enter the metaverse, completely virtual (i.e. with virtual reality) or interact with parts of it in their physical space with the help of augmented and mixed reality.<br/><br/>
          The metaverse can be said to be a revolutionary change by merging the 2D natural scenes with 3D computer graphic scenes. First, there is a difference between the existing PC and mobile-based internet era and the metaverse era in terms of convenience, interaction method, and screen/space expandability. Specifically, it is evolving from a 2D web screen to a 3D spatial web where the limitations of the screen have disappeared. The second is the technical aspect. The technology that implements the metaverse is a composite of General Purpose Technology, XR+DNA (eXtended Reality + Data, Network, and Artificial intelligence). These core technologies aim to implement virtual space as it really is, to perceive it as a person perceives it, and to break down reality and virtual barriers. However, making fully interactive 3D metaverse with high-quality video has never been easier.<br/><br/> 
          Therby, it is necessary to assess the quality of experience (QoE) perceived by users adaptive to those future multimedia systems. In this context, this tutorial aims at bridging METAVERSE media with QoE assessment. Through evaluating the QoE of media experiences, we aim to quantify the users’ perceived quality of a system or service that affects their experience. Moreover, this symposium does not only focus on QoE but aims to understand and quantify the overall user experience, by taking into account personal and situational factors. Finally, we will discuss how to evaluate the QoE for next-generation multimedia from the human cognitive perspective, present the latest articles aligned with the recent industrial trends, contents acquisition, and quality assessment, and have technical exchanges.</h4>

          </br> In this symposium, we present a technology that generates a hyper-realistic redered image of a target person viewed from a various direction with a different motion by referring to an intermediate 3D representation of the human which we call the 3D human entity. Towards this goal, we first construct a multi-camera studio to obtain accurate and sufficient 3D human data to analyze the natural and realistic statistics of humans. Next, we present metrics which quantify the degree of reality perceived by humans based on the human visual perception. Using the quantified sense of reality, we finally develop an ultra-precision technology which generates hyper-realistic images of a person in various viewpoints and motions from a 3D human entity reconstrcted from an image.

          <p class="subtitle"><span class="announce_date"><b>09:40-10:20 am</b></span> - <b>Deep learning for cardiovascular imaging applications.</b> <a href="https://jw09191.github.io/"> <em>Presenter2</em></a>. 
          </br> Clinical practice has been revolutionized through advancements in non-invasive imaging modalities. In particular, the field of cardiovascular medicine has witnessed widespread adoption of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), echocardiography, and nuclear perfusion imaging for day-to-day clinical practice. The incorporation of an imaging approach in the diagnostic and prognostic process has allowed for the institution of precise, patient-oriented and disease-targeted cardiovascular therapies. Nevertheless, manual review and interpretation of increasing volumes of cardiovascular imaging studies have been associated with an inefficient workflow, significant time requirements as well as significant intra- and inter-reader variability. The aim of this session is to share the general methods by which deep learning models have been used for segmentation and classification tasks within the realm of cardiovascular imaging, with an emphasis on the advantages of incorporating artificial intelligence and deep learning within a clinical workflow.

          <p class="subtitle"><span class="announce_date"><b>10:20-11:00 am</b></span> - <b>Clinical context for medical imaging deep learning models: model fusion techniques to combine medical imaging.</b> <a href="https://jw09191.github.io/"> <em>Presenter3</em></a>. 
          </br> Advancements in computer vision and deep learning techniques carry the potential to make significant contributions to healthcare, particularly in fields that utilize medical imaging for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment decisions. The current state of the art deep learning models for automated diagnosis and outcome prediction using medical imaging tend not to consider patient electronic medical records and clinical variables. Pertinent and accurate information regarding the current symptoms and past medical history enables physicians to interpret imaging findings in the appropriate clinical context, leading to higher diagnostic accuracy, better clinical predictions, and ideally a better outcome for the patient. Deep learning models that use images without clinical context will ultimately be limited, just as physicians cannot be effective without the knowledge of the patient's medical records. In this session, we describe different fusion techniques applied to combine medical imaging with other clinical data, and systematically review literature in this field. We will also present current knowledge and summarize the key insights that researchers can use to make advancements in deep learning for medicine.
